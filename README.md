# Object Detection AI Project

This project uses OpenCV's DNN module to perform object detection using a pre-trained SSD MobileNet model. The goal of this project is to detect objects in images by drawing bounding boxes and labeling them with their respective class names.

## Features
- Object detection using the SSD MobileNet model.
- Bounding boxes drawn around detected objects.
- Class names displayed for each detected object.
- Configurable confidence threshold for detection.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khalfaoui-Yassin/object-detection-ai.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd object-detection-ai

3. Navigate to the project directory:
    pip install opencv-python

4. Ensure the required model files are placed in the -SSD MobileNet Model File: Place frozen_inference_graph.pb in the files/ folder.

-Model Configuration File: Place ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14.pbtxt in the files/ folder.

-Class Names File: Place thing.names in the files/ folder.

5. Add the input image:
    -pip install opencv-python
    -You can replace it with your desired image.
